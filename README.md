# DDDSampleDuck
This is the homework #3 - DDD Sample Duck app. 


The application uses Spring Boot. To start it go to the root directory and type `mvn spring-boot:run` or run the `main` method of the `Application` class from your IDE.  
Then open http://localhost:8080/dddsampleduck in your browser (and make sure, that no firewall is blocking the communication).
